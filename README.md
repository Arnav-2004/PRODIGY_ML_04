# Hand Gesture Recognition using CNN

Excited to share insights into my fourth responsibility as a Machine Learning Intern at Prodigy Infotech! This undertaking was particularly captivating, involving the creation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for categorical classification of hand gestures.

To ensure a seamless interpretation of the model's predictions, I crafted a lookup_dict that served as a mapping repository, storing the names of the gestures targeted for identification. Each gesture was assigned a numerical identifier, streamlining the classification process and facilitating a structured representation of the model's output.

Complementing this, I engineered a reverse_lookup_dict offering a reciprocal functionality. This counterpart dictionary provided a quick reference, elucidating which gesture was associated with a given numerical identifier. This bidirectional mapping proved invaluable for post-processing and result interpretation, enhancing the overall utility of the model.

In the pursuit of model optimization, I strategically integrated two pivotal callbacks into the training pipeline. The Early Stop callback acted as a sentinel against overfitting, intelligently halting the training process when the model's performance on a validation dataset showed signs of stagnation. This vigilance was orchestrated by monitoring a specified metric, such as validation loss or accuracy, and employing a graceful intervention if improvement failed to manifest over a predetermined number of consecutive epochs, a parameter controlled by the "patience" setting.

Simultaneously, the Learning Rate Reduction callback played a crucial role in fine-tuning the training process. By dynamically adjusting the learning rate during training, this callback optimized convergence, particularly when the improvement in a specified metric, such as validation accuracy, exhibited a gradual pace or plateaued. This adaptive mechanism expedited convergence, potentially steering the model towards a more optimal minimum in the loss landscape.

This multifaceted project not only deepened my understanding of CNNs in categorical classification but also highlighted the significance of meticulous post-processing strategies and thoughtful integration of callbacks for model refinement. Eager to continue applying these learnings in the ever-evolving field of machine learning!
